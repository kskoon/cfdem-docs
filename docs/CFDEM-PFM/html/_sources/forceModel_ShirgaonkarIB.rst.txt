Description
"""""""""""

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle
interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The *ShirgaonkarIB* model
calculates the drag force (viscous and pressure force) acting on each particle
in a resolved manner (see :ref:`Shirgaonkar et al. (2009) <Shirgaonkar2009>`).
This model is only suited for resolved CFD-DEM simulations where
the particle is represented by immersed boundary method.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


Only for immersed boundary solvers.
