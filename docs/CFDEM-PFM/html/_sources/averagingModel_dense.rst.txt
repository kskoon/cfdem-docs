Description
"""""""""""

The averaging model performs the Lagrangian->Eulerian mapping of data (e.g.
particle velocities). In the "cfdemParticle cloud" this averaging model is used
to calculate the average particle velocity inside a CFD cell. The *dense* model
is supposed to be applied to cases where the granular regime is rather dense.
