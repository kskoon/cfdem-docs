About CFDEMcoupling
===================


CFDEMcoupling provides an open-source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework
combining the strengths of the `LIGGGHTS <http://www.cfdem.com>`_ DEM code and
the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM\ |reg|\ (*).
The CFDEMcoupling toolbox allows to expand standard CFD solvers of
OpenFOAM\ |reg|\ (*) to include a coupling to the DEM code
`LIGGGHTS <http://www.cfdem.com>`_.

In this toolbox the particle representation within the CFD
solver is organized by "cloud" classes. Key functionalities are organized in
sub-models (e.g. force models, data exchange models, etc.) which can easily be
selected and combined by dictionary settings.

The coupled solvers run fully parallel on distributed-memory clusters. Features
are:

* its modular approach allows users to easily implement new models
* its MPI parallelization enables to use it for large scale problems
* the `forum <lig_>`_ on CFD-DEM gives the possibility to exchange with other users / developers
* the use of Git allows to easily update to the latest version
* basic documentation is provided


The project structure:

* *src* directory including the source files of the coupling toolbox and models
* *applications* directory including the solver files for coupled CFD-DEM simulations
* *doc* directory including the documentation of CFDEMcoupling
* *tutorials* directory including basic tutorial cases showing the functionality


Details on installation are given in the :doc:`Installation <CFDEMcoupling_install>`
section.
The functionality of this CFD-DEM framework is described via :doc:`tutorial cases <CFDEMcoupling_tutorials>` showing how to use different solvers and
models.

CFDEMcoupling stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - Discrete Element
Method (DEM) coupling.
