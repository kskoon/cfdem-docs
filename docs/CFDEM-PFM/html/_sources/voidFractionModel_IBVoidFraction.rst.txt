   voidFractionModel IB;

   }

* *number1* = maximum number of cells covered by a particle (search will fail when
  more than *number1* cells are covered by the particle)
* *number2* = minimum limit for void fraction
* *number3* = diameter of the particle's representation is artificially increased
  according to *number3* \* Vparticle, volume remains unaltered!

Description
"""""""""""

The *IB* void fraction model is supposed to be used when a particle (or its
representation) is bigger than a CFD cell. The void fraction field is set in
those cell whose centres are inside the particle. The model is specially
designed for cfdemSolverIB and creates a smooth transition of the void fraction
at the particle surface. Cells which are only partially covered by solid are
marked by void fraction values between 0 and 1 respectively.

The region of influence of a particle can be increased artificially by
"scaleUpVol", which blows up the particles, but keeps their volume (for
void fraction calculation) constant.

Code of this sub-model was contributed by Alice Hager, JKU.
