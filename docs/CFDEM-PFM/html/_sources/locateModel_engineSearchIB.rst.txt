Description
"""""""""""

The locateModel *engineIB* locates the CFD cell and cellID corresponding to a
given position. This locate model is especially designed for parallel immersed
boundary method. Each particle is represented by "satellite points" if it is
distributed over several processors.

The *engineIB* locate Model can be used with different settings to use different
algorithms:

* treeSearch false;  will execute some geometric (linear) search using the last known cellID (recommended)
* treeSearch true;   will use a recursive tree structure to find the cell.


This model is a modification of the *engine* search model. Instead of using the
centre-cell as starting point for the engine search, further satellite points
located on the surface of the sphere are checked. This ensures that (parts of)
spheres can be located even when their centre is on another processor. This is
especially important for parallel computations, when a sphere is about to move
from one processor to another.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


Only for immersed boundary solvers!
